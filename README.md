# COSC 527 - Prescribed Fire Project

## Setting Up the Environment

I have a Windows machine, and installing GDAL on it was very difficult at the time and caused a lot of frustration. What I ended up using was this [geospatial-wheels](https://github.com/cgohlke/geospatial-wheels/) repository by [Christoph Gohlke](https://github.com/cgohlke) and installing the `gdal-[...]-cp313-win_amd64.whl`. 
- If you don't know, you can install a wheel using `pip install [path to .whl file]`.
